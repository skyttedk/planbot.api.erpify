# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Issue Management Workflow

When asked to "do work":
1. Get issues ready for development
2. Update the chosen issue status to "In Progress" 
3. Implement the required changes
4. When complete, update issue status to "In Review"

When creating issues:
- Include full context in the description
- Specify relevant files and line numbers when possible
- Explain the background/motivation for the issue
- Provide enough detail for anyone to understand what needs to be done

## Build and Test Commands

- Frontend dev: `npm run frontend dev`
- Backend dev: `npm run backend dev`
- Backend start: `node server/index.js`
- Run all tests: `npm test`
- Run single test file: `cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules npx jest tests/path/to/file.test.js`
- Watch tests: `npm run test:watch`
- Test with coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
- Pretty test output: `npm run test:pretty`

## Code Style Guidelines

- **ES Modules**: Use import/export syntax - project uses ES modules (type: "module")
- **Field Template Pattern**: Follow field.template structure when creating new field types
  - All field classes must follow the naming convention ClassNameField (e.g. StringField, EmailField)
  - Always set unique UID for each field in fixedProperties
  - Always include complete documentation with description, examples, and usage
  - Always pass fieldName to super() as the second parameter
  - Custom properties must be set AFTER super() call
  - Use onSet() and onGet() methods for field-specific validation and transformation logic
  - Use 'varchar' type name for string fields, not 'string'
  - **IMPORTANT**: Reuse existing field templates when appropriate rather than creating new ones:
    - For enumerated values, use EnumField with the options property
    - For string fields, use the appropriate StringXX field (String10, String20, String50, String100, String250)
    - Create custom field templates only when they have unique validation or transformation logic
- **Model Template Pattern**: Follow model.template structure when creating new models
- **Error Handling**: Use try/catch blocks with specific error messages
- **Naming**: PascalCase for classes, camelCase for variables/functions
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments for classes and methods
- **Architecture**: Follow the MVC pattern with model-driven development approach
- **Code Cleanup**: Keep code clean, sleek and simple; avoid unnecessary complexity
- **Simplicity**: Don't build a "Rube Goldberg Machine" - aim for the simplest solution

## Adding New Components

- **Field Templates**: Create in server/models/fields following the field.template structure
- **Model Templates**: Create in server/models following the model.template structure
- **Always add new fields** to fieldPaths in server/models/fields/index.js
- **Always add new models** to modelPaths in server/models/index.js

## Project Vision

AI.ERPIFY is a Rapid Application Development platform for quickly building business applications with minimal coding, inspired by Microsoft Access and Dynamics NAV.

## Key Architectural Components

### Database Tier

- PostgreSQL database with pooled connections
- Caching mechanisms via global objects
- Automatic schema synchronization through ORM

### Server Tier

- Node.js backend with WebSockets
- Custom ORM with transaction support and field templates
- JWT-based authentication and RBAC authorization

### Field Templates System

- Centralized field definitions for consistency
- Reusable field components with validation
- Field inheritance and override capabilities
- Auto-generated UI components from field templates
- Fixed properties combined with allowed overrides
- Custom transformations via onSet() and onGet() hooks
- Each field has a unique identifier (UID) for registration
- Base Field class provides core validation functionality
- Field-specific logic encapsulated within each template

### Socket Communication

- Structured message format for client-server communication
- Request/response pattern with unique request IDs
- Event-based architecture for real-time updates
